## RNN Analysis of Amazon Fine Food Reviews

Notes: 
- seaborn does not exist in the working AMI bitfusion

## Data preprocessing
TODO:
- [x] Create graphs and detailed information about the data set

https://github.com/yanndupis/RNN-Amazon-Fine-Food-Reviews/blob/master/Amazon%20Fine%20Food%20Reviews.ipynb

- [ ] test in train in tflearn
- [ ] Look into a bigger beef cake
- [ ] look into the maxlen for each review & graph
- [ ] define variable maxlen (siraj used maxlen=100)
- [ ] remove pos_tagging (prepositions)
- [ ] Train data

## Lexicon Approach
TODO:
- [ ] Create Lexicon based approach to compare against RNN

## Training
TODO:
- [ ] Create 1 model and train 5 different test sets 

## Visualizations
TODO:
- [ ] Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve
- [ ] classification_report 
- [ ] confusion matrix
